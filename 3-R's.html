                    The principle of reducing waste, reusing and recycling resources and products is often called the "3Rs." 
                    <br>Reducing means choosing to use things with care to reduce the amount of waste generated. <br>Reusing involves the repeated use of items or parts of items which still have usable aspects. <br>Recycling means the use of waste itself as resources. <br><br><br><br><br>Waste minimization can be achieved in an efficient way by focusing primarily on the first of the 3Rs, "reduce," followed by "reuse" and then "recycle."

                    <b>Reduce : </b>The first step is to reduce the amount of waste produced in the first place. This involves minimizing the consumption of resources and products. Examples include:
                    <ui>
                        <li>Using digital documents instead of printing on paper to reduce paper waste.</li>
                        <li>Buying products with minimal packaging or packaging that is biodegradable or recyclable.</li>
                        <li>Choosing durable goods over disposable ones to reduce the frequency of replacements.</li>
                        <li>Composting organic waste to reduce the amount of trash sent to landfills.</li>
                    </ui>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Reuse : </b>This step focuses on finding new uses for items rather than throwing them away after a single use. This can extend the life of products and reduce the need for new resources. Examples include:
                    <ui>
                        <li>Donating clothes,furniture instead of throwing them away.</li>
                        <li>Using reusable shopping bags instead of single-use plastic bags.</li>
                        <li>Repurposing glass jars and containers for storing food or organizing small items.</li>
                        <li>Using re-filling water bottles instead single-use plastic bottles.</li>
                    </ui>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Recycle : </b> This step includes processing waste into new materials. It reduces the need of raw materials.
                    <ui>
                        <li>Recycling paper, plastic, glass, and metal containers through curbside recycling programs.</li>
                        <li>Handover e-waste to designated recycling centers for proper disposal and recovery of valuable materials.</li>
                        <li>Upcycle broken items into new products. Example :- turning old textile into art projects.</li>
                        <li>Purchasing products made from recycled materials to support the market for recycled goods.</li>
                    </ui>
                </p1>
